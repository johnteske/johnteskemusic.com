I had been thinking a lot about where I put my attention and where we collectively put our attention; how we can have focus, lose it, and return to it. These scores are based on the idea of sound coming in and out of focus. Each improviser reads off the same score, aiming to realize composition as an ensemble. The scores are simple shapes that are designed to draw the ear to the subtleties of timbre and texture.<p>These pieces have been performed a number of times over the last year, from solos to string quartets to large mixed ensembles. For this performance, we will be realizing the scores rather quietly. I've found that taking excessive volume out of the equation allows for the details to be heard more clearly.<p>You can listen to a recording of the original performance here:<p><a href="http://johnteske.bandcamp.com/album/six-graphic-scores">http://johnteske.bandcamp.com/album/six-graphic-scores</a><p>For the improvisation session following, I would hope to contribute one core idea: that each ensemble might huddle before the improvisation, pick one or two simple musical ideas to focus on, and realize it as an ensemble. This may mean that not everyone need to play at once or that each individual may play a small part that contributes to the overall sound. In my performance of minimalist improvisation, the focus required is different, yet very rewarding.<p><span class=subtitle>compositions</span><p>           <i>six graphic scores </i>(2010)<br /><p><span class=subtitle>recordings</span><p><a href="http://racersessions.com/private/11260276285/tumblr_lstzjxCKjD1qahzi7">A full recording of the graphic scores and following improvisations can be found on the Racer Sessions site.</a><p></div><footer>	<a href="http://twitter.com/johnteske" class=footlink>twitter</a>  	<a href="https://www.facebook.com/johnteskemusic" class=footlink>facebook</a>  	<a href="http://eepurl.com/c3rmw" class=footlink>mailing list</a> 	<a href="http://johnteskemusic.com/contact.html" class=footlink>contact</a></footer></body></html>
