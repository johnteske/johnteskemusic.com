      <p>Seattle-based composer John Teske writes contemporary concert music for soloists, chamber groups, and chamber orchestra.
Founder of the Broken Bow Ensemble and a series of “any ensemble” performances, he focuses on enhancing the listener experience, utilizing extended techniques and guided improvisation to create pieces that are crafted while maintaining a human and organic feel.
His recent work includes <em>topographies</em>, a series of musical contour maps through which musicians navigate, site-specific performances in Seattle parks, and a series of works for chamber orchestra exploring consciousness and awareness.
His music has been performed across the United States, in France, Brazil, and Russia, and has been supported by the Seattle Office of Arts &amp; Cultural Affairs, the Jack Straw Foundation, and the City of Seattle.</p>

<h2>Double bass trailer</h2>
<p>During the warm months, I travel to rehearsals and performances by bicycle, towing my bass in a custom-made trailer.
In the winter, I park the trailer and focus on composing new works.</p>
