<span class=title><i>six graphic scores</i></span><span class=subtitle>(2010, revised 2012)</span> for any ensemble
<p>

For a few years I had been thinking a lot about where I put my attention and where we collectively put our attention; how we can have focus, lose it, and return to it. These scores are based on the idea of sound coming in and
out of focus.<br />
<br />
The original scores allowed for a wide range of interpretations. After a number of performances I wanted to add more direction to the work by defining pitch centers and removing the urge for excessive volume. I hope the latter of these revisions allows the listener to focus on the subtle changes in pitch and texture.<br />
<br />
These scores are intended for performance by one or more musicians. The horizontal axis represents relative time, the vertical axis represents relative pitch, and the quality of the markings denotes texture, relative duration, and density.
