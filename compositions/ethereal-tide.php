<span class=title><i>ethereal tide</i></span><span class=subtitle>(2011)</span> for violoncello and double bass
<p>

Written for Amelia K. Bowler as an epilogue to <a href="ocean-love-scene.html"><i>Ocean Love Scene in Two Keys</i></a>. Both instruments leave their original tonal center for more ambiguous tones. It is in this space they find common ground and resolution.
