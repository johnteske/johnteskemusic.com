							Seattle-based composer John Teske writes contemporary concert music for soloists, chamber groups, and chamber orchestra. Founder of the Broken Bow Ensemble and a series of “any ensemble” performances, he focuses on enhancing the listener experience, utilizing extended techniques and guided improvisation to create pieces that are crafted while maintaining a human and organic feel. His recent work includes <em>topographies</em>, a series of musical contour maps through which musicians navigate, site-specific performances in Seattle parks, and a series of works for chamber orchestra exploring consciousness and awareness. His music has been performed across the United States, in France, Brazil, and Russia, and has been supported by the Seattle Office of Arts &amp; Cultural Affairs, the Jack Straw Foundation, and the City of Seattle. John is also an organizer and curator of new music, including the Seattle Composers' Salon, a bi-monthly presentation of local composers that facilitates experimentation and discussion.
<!-- 							John graduated from the University of Washington, where he studied with Jo&euml;l-Fran&ccedil;ois Durand, Juan Pampin, and Josh Parmenter.

						<p>My recent work has been exploring the nature of human consciousness, awareness, and sensation. As our culture becomes more interconnected, the experience of time seems to be accelerating and the average attention span is diminishing. Through altering the experience of time through music, I hope to bring to attention greater subtleties of sound.

						<p>During the warm months, I travel to rehearsals and performances by bicycle, towing my bass in a custom-made trailer. In the winter, I park the trailer and focus on composing new works.
