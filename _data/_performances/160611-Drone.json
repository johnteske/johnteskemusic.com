  "short": "site-specific work with Nat Evans",
  "long": "This work for brass, electronics, and additional sound implements will be presented at the Georgetown Steam Plant, with audience members being invited to come and go at any time. In absence of the original drone from the machinery of the steam plant providing electricity to the city of Seattle, this score from Evans and Teske responds to this historic space to create a new musical drone. These drones—long, expansive notes—were written specifically to take advantage of Georgetown Steam Plant's singular resonance.<br /><br />As the performance will take place on multiple levels throughout the cavernous space, audience members are invited to explore the building and hear the music changing and responding throughout the space and over time. <em>Drone Restoration</em> is improvisatory in nature, with the players responding to each other, the space and musical cues created by Evans and Teske.",
