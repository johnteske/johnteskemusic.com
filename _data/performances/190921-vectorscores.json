  "long": "Seattle composer John Teske presents a new suite of graphic and generated works for any ensemble as part of his ongoing vectorscores project. Since 2016, John has been writing music with vectorscores, which uses web technologies to generate and render scores. The shape of each piece is composed, with some flexibility in the details, so the works as a whole are crafted but each performance is unique. The new suite explores some recurring thoughts, visions, and dreams from a dark and surreal time, as well as expanding on the potential of the vectorscores project. Performed by the Any Ensemble: Greg Campbell, percussion; Neil Welch, saxophone; Luke Fitzpatrick, violin; Haley Freedlund, trombone; Noel Kennon, viola; John Teske, double bass. Presented by <a href='https://www.nseq.org/'>Nonsequitur</a>."
